 * are independent rather than steps on one path: on the live books a payment
 * can be settled by the accountant while Midday holds no document for it, and
 * can have a document in Midday that the accountant has never seen. Anything
 * that collapses them into a single ladder has to render one of those two cells
 * dishonestly, which is why they stay apart all the way to the screen.
 *
 * Derived rather than stored, every time. All three facts it reads — an
 * attachment row, a pending suggestion, the transaction's own status — are
 * Midday's own and cannot drift from themselves. `books_status` is stored
 * precisely because it is *not* Midday's own; see `booksStatusEnum`.

 *
 * A document with no transaction is not necessarily unfinished. Three reasons
 * it can be legitimately done, measured on the live inbox:
 *
 * - **It came from the books** (78). The accountant has it and has booked it.
 * - **It charges nothing** (21). No payment was ever going to appear.
 * - **It is not an invoice** (32).
 *
 * ## Judge the group, not the row
 *
 * When the pull found an invoice Midday already held, it filed the copy against
 * the original via `grouped_inbox_id`. So the finishing facts are checked across
 * every member of the group: today 4 rows sit at `pending`, `suggested_match`
 * or `analyzing` whose twin in the same group is already booked, and reading
 * rows one at a time shows all four as work that does not exist.
